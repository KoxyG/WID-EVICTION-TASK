# JavaScript Classwork - Arrays, OOP, and Error Handling

Welcome to your JavaScript classwork repository! This project contains three tasks to help you practice Arrays & Array Methods, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Error Handling using try-catch in JavaScript.

## Task Overview

You will work on the following tasks:

- **Arrays & Array Methods**: Working with arrays and using built-in array methods like `.map()`, `.reduce()`, and `.filter()`.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Creating a class, adding methods, and understanding basic OOP concepts.
- **Error Handling**: Using try and catch for error handling in a function that divides numbers.
